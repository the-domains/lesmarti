_I leave footprints where ever I go.  I've left plenty in Italy. Starting with Milan, Venice, Burano and finally Roma.  Although, I loved it all Venice was all that and more. With it's  early risers working hard to prepare for the droves of tourist that would be there soon, the fresh smells from the bakery to the the colors in fresh produce.  The city was alive and full of energy. __The cracks  and levels taped to the walls that  mark incremental changes in stability makes you well aware it won't always be here. So, Enjoy this gift of a city and Viva Itlay._
